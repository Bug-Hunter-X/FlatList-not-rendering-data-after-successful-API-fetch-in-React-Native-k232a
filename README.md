# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using FlatList in React Native: the component fails to render data even after a successful API fetch.  The provided code showcases the problem and a solution.

## Problem

The `DataList.js` file contains a component that fetches data from a sample API endpoint. Despite the data being fetched correctly, the `FlatList` component remains empty.

## Solution

The `DataListSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the component, addressing the issue by ensuring data is properly handled and displayed.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to run the app.
